#Keeping baby warm

In this lesson students will investigate the 

##Learning objectives

- Understand that the transfer of heat can be stopped by an insulator
- Understand that some materials are better at insulating than others


##All students are able to

- Measure the temperature of different objects 
- Identify that some materials are better at insulating than others

##Most students are able to

- Collect temperature results for different materials
- Identify which materials are the best at insulating

##Some students are able to

- Explain which surface are the best at insulating heat

##Lesson Summary

- Students will setup the Sense HAT to record temperatures of a hot water bottle cooling
- Students will record temperatures of different materials cooling down

##Starter

- Set the scene that parents want to keep their baby warm in a cot. They have various materials they can wrap the baby in, but they don't know which one to use.


##The Data Logger

- To access the resources for this investigation, open a LXTerminal and type: `sudo python3 baby.py`

##Measuring 

1. Explain to students that the Sense HAT contains sensors that can measure temperature.

1. Setup the apparatus to measure the temperature of the Sense Hat at cools down. The heat source for this experiment will come from a hot water bottle. Other surfaces can be used, and a risk assesment should be performed before starting the experiment.

##Carrying out the experiment

1. Heat up water in a kettle and fill up the hot water bottle carefully ensuring than any air is released before screwing the lid on.
1. Wrap a Raspberry Pi in a sandwich bag.
1. Wrap the Raspberry Pi in a material to keep the baby warm.
1. Start the code and enter a suitable filename for the results.
1. Enter the number of results required and the interval between each measurement.
1. Allow the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to warm up for approximately ten minutes
1. When instructed remove the heat source and rewrap the Pi
1. Leave the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT to cool down.
1. Once the results have been collected they will be written to a file which can be analyzed with Excel.
1. Repeat with a range of different materials. Start with a fresh hot water bottle each time.

##Analysis of the results

- Once the results have been saved the file can be accessed by importing into a spreadsheet or by printing out the raw data file.
- Students to plot a graph of temperature change against time.

##Plenary

- Ask students to identify which material cooled down the quickest.
- Which materials were the best insulators?
- Which materials would you recommend using to keep baby warm?

##Extension

- Add an extension task here.

##Risk assessment

In addition to the points below a full risk assessment should be carried out by institution using this experiment.

- The Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT must be placed in a sandwich bag to avoid any water touching the equipment.
- When wrapping the Sense HAT and Raspberry Pi in silver foil it is important to prevent a short circuit by wrapping the Pi in a non-conductive material such as clingfilm.
