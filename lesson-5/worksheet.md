# Investigating fermentation of yeast

In this lesson we will investigate the factors which speed up the fermentation of yeast.

## Theory 

Fermentation is the process of converting sugars to alcohol using yeast. This is a slow reaction which releases carbon dioxide.

Glucose (sugar) --> Ethanol (Alcohol) + Carbon dioxide

Ethanol is a type of alcohol which is found in alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. Ethanol is formed by the fermentation of glucose, using yeast as a natural catalyst. This reaction usually works best around 37 degrees centigrade. This is a slow process, though: it can take several weeks to produce an alcoholic drink.

## Experiment  

- Collect a 250 ml conical flask and ensure that you can fit a balloon over the opening.
- Measure out 100 ml of apple juice, add a couple of heaped spatulas of sugar and mix well.
- Add approximately 50 ml of freshly prepared yeast solution.
- Attach the balloon to the conical flask and place in a water bath at 25 degrees centigrade.
- Start the Python code .
- Leave the flask in the water bath for the next hour.
- Repeat the experiment and increase the water bath to 30 degrees centigrade.
- Repeat again until you get to 50 degrees centigrade.

## Analysis of the results

- Open the folder called lesson-5; there will be a timelapse series of photos for each temperature.
- Using a ruler, measure the maximum diameter of the balloon in each photo and record on a table. Each photo was taken with a five minute interval.
- Plot a graph of balloon diameter against time for each temperature.

## Extension

- Repeat the experiment but vary the quantity of apple juice, yeast and sugar used.
