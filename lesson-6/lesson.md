# Investigating choice chambers and insect habitats

In this lesson we will investigate what colour of habitat is preferred by different insects.

## Learning objectives

- To plan and carry out an investigation into choice chambers and insect habitats

## All students are able to

- Handle insects carefully
- Understand that investigations using insects have to be carried out with consideration for the health of the insect

## Most students are able to 

- Plan an investigation to find out what colour of habitat is preferred by different insects
- Interpret results from choice chamber experiments

## Some students are able to

- Evaluate the ethics behind using insects in experiments

## Lesson summary

- During this lesson students will collect various insects (carefully) from around the school site and use them to find out if they are attracted to light sources of different colours.


## Starter

- Hold a short class discussion on the use of animals and insects in science experiments. Identify a common set of rules that everyone should follow when using live insects during experiments.
- Involve pupils in the process of agreeing on any precautions for the activity and discuss the risks.

## The data logger

- To access the resources for this investigation, type the following into LXTerminal: `sudo python3 respiration.py`.

## Carrying out the experiment

- Collect your insect species and place them into a sealed clean petri dish. Ensure that you have suitable water and vegetation for the insect you will be studying,
- Place the petri dish on top of the LED matrix.  
- Place the Raspberry Pi camera above the LED matrix, pointing down towards the insects.
- Start the program `choice_chambers.py`.
- The LED matrix will cycle through a range of colours. After thirty seconds to allow the insects to settle, the camera will take two photographs five seconds apart.

Colour patterns:

- 100% white
- 50% white and 50% off
- 25% white and 75% off
- 100% red
- 50% red and 50% off
- 25% red and 75% off
- 100% blue
- 50% blue and 50% off
- 25% blue and 75% off
- 100% green
- 50% green and 50% off
- 25% green and 75% off
- 50% green and 50% blue
- 50% green and 50% red
- 50% red and 50% blue


## Analysis of the results

- Open the folder containing science_task6. There will be two photos taken with each experiment.
- Produce a tally chart to count how many insects are in each section from the photos.
- Is there sufficient data to identify a clear pattern?

## Plenary 

- Is it possible to write a valid scientific conclusion based on the observations recorded?

## Extension

- Edit the code to change the patterns/colours used.
- Does the species of insect make a difference?

## Risk assessment

- Please read the relevant local documentation about handling insects in school classrooms. Students should wash their hands after completing each experiment.

In addition, the following risks should be considered:

- Pupils and teachers may experience an allergic reaction: contact with fur and feathers are known to induce an allergic reaction in some people.
- Bites and stings from insects.
- Animal welfare.

Suitable control measures could include:

- Identify any pupils with medical conditions, including those with respiratory problems and allergies.
- Ensure inhalers are readily available.
- Warn pupils about hand, eye and mouth contact when handling creatures.
- Any pupil or adult with an open cut on their hands, with infected cuts or who is suffering from an infection, must not handle the animals or come into contact with them.
- Collect small creatures for study using a pooter or a paintbrush to avoid harming them.
- Return small invertebrates collected from the environment as soon as possible.
- Pupils and adults must wash their hands after touching insects.
